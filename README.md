TODO:
- [ ] EmailInput & PasswordInput have hardcoded names. The consuming forms use the name to get the value and could lead to bugs if one or the other changes accidentally.
- [x] Rename `signup` route to `sign-up`.
- [ ] Move `access_token` string to a constant, because constants are better and cooler.
- [ ] Flush out readme with better information about packages/tech/things used.
